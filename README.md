#Portfolio

I created this portfolio to illustrate my CV online and as part of my Milestone project.
I integrated different aspects of design into my portfolio which otherwise would not be possible on a traditional paper CV which was great.
 
## UX
 I designed my project with prospective employers and fellow Software developers in mind. 
 To do this I wanted to design a visually appealing website using attractive images and a navigation which alows the user to browse seamlessly through the project.
 I used responsive components in my project to ensure users of all computers and devices would share an equal experience.
 Making an online portfolio as a student software developer was an obvious choice as it is a perfect demonstration of your skills to date and I hope I transferred mine across in this project.
 
User Stories
As a user I would like an attractive webpage that is easy to navigate and can adapt to any device I choose to use.
As a user I would like to be able to quickly jump to which sections I am interested in on the webpage without having to scroll continuoulsy.
As a user I would like to find information I need quickly through clearly displayed information.

As a Software developer I would like to see a project that was visually attractive and contained some beneficial ideas which may pertain to future projects. 

As an employer I would like to see a well developed project which is structured well and incorporates styling elements which benefit the project and display a candidates ability.
As an employer I would like to see that the project clearly illustrates information required by an employer, such as previous projects, Languages known, Education and any relevant work experience to the position required to be filled.

## Features

Nav 
I used a nav template and scrollspy template from w3 Schools
I created a Nav which would blend in seamlessly with the color scheme of the project which came out being predominantly blue.
The Nav incorporated options which using a scroll spy linked to sections of the project - Home, About, Projects, Work Experience and Contact.
I also made the Nav collapsable to allow for mobile and tablet devices to navigate more freely

About 
I used a background image from pexels and overlayed it using informative text

Personal Bio
I again, used a background image I took myself comined with text about mention

Projects
I used a background image from pexels and incorporated a container with three sections over two rows
The sections contained examples of projects I have done, Languages I have learned ; both containing collapsing buttons leading to more information or hyperlinks to Github.

Work Experience
I followed the tutorial on Code Institute to complete the timeline
I used a colored background inline with the color scheme and placed a timeline for both my Education & employment incorporating all relevant dates and relevant information about the qualifications and roles.

Contact / Footer
I used a template which I edited on w3 Schools 
I used a colored background (1 of two blue colors used from ColorHunt.com) to differentiate from the previous (Work Experience) section 
I included contact information and also a form which would allow anyone interested in contacting me to easily submit a query.]

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
